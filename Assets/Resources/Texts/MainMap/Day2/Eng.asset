    - Everyone has also thought of that solution, but it is impossible
    - The phone signal here is very weak, normally there will be a mobile base station
      to maintain contact
    - But it was also vandalized beyond repair
    - The only solution now is to try to fix the car, then leave here and notify
      the authorities

    - I don't know what everyone thinks, but I think this will be complicated
    - The saboteur wants us to be isolated here, which means he's afraid we might
      bring something out.
    - Or afraid we might know some information and let it out
    - If so, then it will really have a lot to do with Linh, because she is suffering
      from memory loss, so being here might make her remember something.

    - Not really
    - What you know is only a part that has been published, there is actually a secret
      behind it
    - After the accident, I also participated in cleanup and search and rescue
    - I found a bloody knife
    - The police had the knife examined to see what blood it contained. They said
      it was just animal blood and explained that it was someone's knife recently
      butchering animals.
    - But according to my observation and experience, it is definitely not animal
      blood clots
    - I'm sure that knife is related to the mysterious young man who appeared with
      your family
    - The police knew that, so they arranged and agreed with me to keep this information
      confidential
    - If this information is actually revealed, it will cause great confusion among
      public opinion

    - Not only that
    - Since the landslide, I noticed that the trees above were very strangely nailed
    - Oh, I also found a file in the rubble
    - In it was a piece of paper that had just been written on, it even had blood
      stains and knife cuts, but because of a landslide, some of its content was
      lost.
    - The document was confiscated by the police for investigation, but I still remembers
      what was written in it
    - Later, I will show everyone that paper in the house
    - Now I need to go to the garden to check how the previous nails were nailed
      on the tree. I just noticed it but didn't write anything down.

    - I noticed that there were a few trees and nails that were indented, and it
      would be difficult to detect when checking
    - So there may be trees that I count that are missing nails
