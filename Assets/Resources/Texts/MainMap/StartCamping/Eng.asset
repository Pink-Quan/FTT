    - That young man appeared mysteriously, and also mysteriously disappeared
    - After the accident, the police could not find information about that young
      man
    - So it was listed as missing

    Name: Linh
    DisplayName: Linh

    keyValue: 
  - sentances:
    - Because after the accident, the police investigated and could not find any
      information related to that fourth person and your family.
    - They couldn't even find any information about that young man
    - So they concluded that maybe this tourist was a traveler with the same travel
      schedule as your family
    - Not only that, it's also due to the press
    - Your survival and loss are so well known that articles and readers focus only
      on you
    - Although the official state newspaper published all the information, the media
      effect was so strong that the anonymous missing person was not noticed at all.
    - You know, news sites only care about the money they make, so they forget about
      that young man.
    - That's all we know
