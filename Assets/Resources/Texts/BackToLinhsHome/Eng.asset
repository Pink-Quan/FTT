    - So that accident caused you not to remember anything

  - sentances:
    - Not really
    - I still remember what I learned, the past from before the accident happened
    - But the past is so long ago that I don't remember much
    - "\rFor example, I still remember some knowledge from university"

    - Oh is that so?
    - "\rSo do you remember the Maclaurin expansion of the function f(x)?"
    - Or do you remember the relationship between infrastructure and superstructure?

    - The Maclaurin expansion of the function f(x) is
    - 'f(a) + (f''(a)*(x-a))/1! + (f''''(a)*(x-a)^2)/2! + ... + (fn(a)*(x-a)^n)/n! '
    - The relationship between infrastructure and superstructure and infrastructure
      is
    - A dialectical relationship in which infrastructure or production relations
      play a decisive role
    - In other words, it is the relationship between economics and politics, in which
      economics is the key and dominates politics

    - Though
    - The past is so long that I don't remember much
    - I can't remember my past and previous relationships, even what my parents looked
      like
    - I only remember them taking care of me, but I can't really feel any emotions
    - I wish they were here to help me
    - Hic
